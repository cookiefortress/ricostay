                <p>What is Ricochet?</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                
                <p class="details">Ricochet is a 2000 arena "shooter" game developed by Valve. It's a relatively basic modification of Half-Life,
                likely created by Valve as a means to show off the capabilities of modding using the Goldsrc engine. In the game's infancy, it boasted
                decent player counts, even having dedicated clans and players making montages. Nowadays, it harbors a very small but dedicated playerbase.</p>
                    <div class="pictureSub">
                        <img src="indexPics/pow_visual.png" alt="An unused Ricochet powerup" class="picWithSubtext">
                        <div class="subtext">A mysterious, unused "visual" powerup found within the game's files</div>
                    </div>
                <p class="details">Rather than shooting guns, players throw discs. These discs have two varieties; push shots and decapitation shots. You can change
                which type you want to throw by either left or right clicking. These discs' abilities are further altered through the use of powerups. Players jump
                around from pad to pad, trying to either push one another off with push shots, or instakill with decapitation shots.</p>
                <p class="details">Ricochet, similar to some other Valve-crafted Half-Life mods like Deathmatch Classic, never took off like the Counter-Strike, Team Fortress,
                and of course, Half-Life series did. Being a relatively simple game that Valve didn't add much content to over time, it has slowly lost what playerbase it once had
                over the past couple of decades. Regardless, it maintains some active players, and some small communities play games together on a frequent basis. Many active
                servers do host bots as a means of playing while no other humans are online.</p>

                    <p class="leftDetails">Ricochet can be purchased on Steam for $5 regularly. However, I do recommend that you wait for a sale before purchasing the game
                    (Summer Sale, Winter Sale and so forth). It's usually only dollar individually during those times.</p>
                    <p class="leftDetails">Better yet, you can buy the
                    <i><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/232/Valve_Complete_Pack/" target="_blank">Valve Complete Pack</a></i>
                    which, on sale, will run you a little less than $20 and includes many other amazing Valve classics like the Half-Life series, Day of Defeat,
                    and another favorite of mine, Deathmatch Classic, as well as others. Keep in mind this bundle doesn't include any of Valve's newer offerings like Half-Life: Alyx.</p>
