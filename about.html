                        I'm Zander, but online I usually go by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/donateacookieplz/" target="_blank">cookie</a>.
                        My first ever experience with a Valve title was <i><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a></i>,
                        like many PC users, since it's both popular and free. This was probably around age 11~ when I got my first computer. For a while I stuck with TF2,
                        occasionally getting some other games like Call of Duty (which I often still got on Xbox to play with friends), and it wasn't until a Black Friday sale when
                        I was maybe 13 that I got the Valve Complete Pack.

                        I remember the night I asked my dad to get it; initially I found it when looking into getting Portal, but some other games like Day of Defeat caught my eye.
                        I was really bored, I believe it was actually the Thursday just before Black Friday, and I wanted something to do, so I kept asking my dad for it; the pack costed
                        $20. Once I got it, I downloaded all the games, and they kind of blew my mind.

                        I've always loved old-school games; one of my first consoles was a Sega Genesis,
                        pretty archaic for a 2004 kid. I think it was at this point, though, that I realized I was a sucker for early-3D graphics, and especially Goldsrc. So booting into
                        the likes of Half-Life and Team Fortress Classic was awesome for me, I loved the gritty visuals, and just the overall charm that comes with games from the time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="contentText">
                        My first true love was Deathmatch Classic. Somewhat unfortunate given how hard it is to find other players, but something about that title really intrigued me,
                        and I'd hang around in servers waiting for someone to frag with. I even got pretty decent at bhopping given all the time I was just waiting around. I
                        made a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1314788378" target="_blank">pretty solid guide</a> for the game (which I've improved upon
                        over the years).
                    </p>
                    <p class="contentText">
                        I've always seen Ricochet as Deathmatch Classic's twin; a great game that has been largely forgotten with time. It sucks when you love them so much, but it's
                        fortunate that many others feel the same and still get on to play. Ricochet is one of the few games from the era I can get my non-polygon-loving friends to play
                        with me, since its so easy to pick up and have some fun/a laugh in.

                        I've made this website as part of improving upon my webdev skills, but also for a love of Ricochet and its history! I hope you can find some value out of it.
